This is a pet project to learn the basics on Kotlin and Blockchain technology.

## Motivation
I have been on a Management position for quite a bit now and I want to code again.
I decided to start a project from scratch mixing Kotlin and Blockchain. Reasons?
- Kotlin: I want to get my hands dirty with Kotlin because I am coming from Java and I haven't fallen in love with it yet. I find it quite difficult to follow during some code-reviews at work and I have the impression that it might be because I haven't worked directly with it very much.
- Blockchain: I think I kind of grasp the general idea but I want to see how further I can implement my own "blockchain-wannabe".

## Technologies
* Language: Kotlin
* Frameworks/Libraries:
	* Spring boot

## What are we doing?
Good question! But you won't like the answer: I do not know.
Frst I need to understand better what are all the "components" involved in a so-called "Blockchain".
Obviously there is a mining program, people running it (miners), there's also a blockchain and there are some wallets. How do all of this connect?
[Will continue updating here ...]

## TODO
* [ ] Understand all the parts involved in a Blockchain
* [ ] Document all the parts involved in simple terms
* [ ] Initialize a Spring Boot app - or more?
